# JJs-Unciv-Tweaks

A mod for the great UNCIV game. Aiming to get rid of some issues in terms of balance and logic. (Thanks to "Zoltan" for inspiration)

 * Crossbowman unit type is too strong in close combat: strength lowered 13 - 2 = 11
 * Swordsman unit type is rather in-efficient. To make it useful: strenght increased 14 + 1 = 15 (legion: 18)
 * Pikeman unit type now upgrades to Musketman (rather than suddenly becoming mounted)
 * Lancer unit type now upgrades to Cavalry (rather than suddenly becoming un-mounted)
 * Battle Ship now upgrades to the superior Missle Cruiser
 * Generals are on horseback and should therefore be fast: movement increased 2 + 2 = 4 (Khan: 5 + 1 = 6)
 * Triplane is a sad fighter: Intercept increased 50% --> 100%
 * Stealth Bomber is invincible? No more: interceptor damage -100% --> -50%
 * Anti-Tank-Gun is too late: now available with ealier tech "Ballistics"
